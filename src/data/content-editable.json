          "Today, A&V Squires Plant Co. Ltd has over 75 employees and is one of the leading civil engineering, contract earth moving and plant hire companies in the East Midlands. We cover Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire but also operate on a national scale.",
          "In 1971 Doug and Vivienne Squires first established A&V Squires as a plant hire company in Southwell. It has been a family run business with a strong tradition of excellence.",
          "In the early 1990s management of the company was gradually passed over to Doug and Vivienne's two sons Philip and Robert. They both played a major role in the company's relocation to new purpose-built premises in Southwell in 2001, complete with offices and a workshop.",
          "It was after this move that Doug then handed complete control to his sons. Working together, they ensured that the company continued to expand and grow to become one of the largest plant hire and earth moving contractors in the East Midlands. Civil engineering was also added to the services offered and is an area of specialism that has gone from strength-to-strength over the past fifteen years, complementing the plant side of the business.",
          "After the sad passing of Philip in February 2009, Robert took sole responsibility for the company. He is assisted by a highly-qualified and experienced team and they continue to drive the company forward."
